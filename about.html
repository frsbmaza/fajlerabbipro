							<p>Cubeinside Design Limited, founded by a group of young
                            likeminded architects, has already earned a distinct reputation
                            for their signatory works in the field of architecture and interior
                            design. CUBEINSIDE has won several awards including lst
                            place in national design competition of “Head quarter of
                            Anjuman Mufidul Islam” organized by Institute of Architects
                            Bangladesh (lAB) in 2013. The following project is a vacation
                            house at Gazipur, conceived to celebrate the tranquillity of
                            Nature, an example that shows the creative aptitude of the
                            design team.

							<p>The beauty of an intelligent design scheme lies in its invisibility,
								this core idea works behind the formulation of each design by
								Cubeinside team. The principle aim of this plot is only to
								preserve and perpetuate beauty in its natural form of drama and
								picturesqueness- to give the landscape room to grow into a
								living space. Sculpture House in Gazipur, this vacation house is
								designed for a family of 7 people which is located at lslampur,
								Gazipur -a sub urban/industrial area near Dhaka. The 4 acre site
								has a plenty to offer for a placing a vacation house, where the
								final location of the building mass was selected in such a way
								that it could get the highest exposure to the surroundings and
								also creates a sense of authority over the site, which was a
								primary concern of the client.
